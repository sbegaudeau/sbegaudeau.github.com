Earlier this year, we have talked about our work to move Sirius in the web. Back in Sirius 6.0, we have introduced our workflow DSL which is rendered in Eclipse using web technologies.

This summer, we worked on a prototype integrating Eclipse Sirius in [Theia](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ecd.theia) and [Che](https://www.eclipse.org/che). Next monday during the [EclipseCon community day](https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2018/eclipse-che-theia-contributor-summit), we will present how we have built this prototype to integrate Sirius in web based IDEs.

Now, with the release of Sirius 6.1, we are previewing some new web-related features starting with the first version of our GraphQL API. For those of you who will be at EclipseCon Europe next week, we will talk about the way we have integrated [GraphQL with EMF and Sirius](https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2018/sessions/graphql-api-emf) to build our HTTP API.

During this conference, we will also details the various improvements made in Sirius 6.1 and additional web-related work to [start bringing it into the cloud](https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2018/sessions/modeling-tools-go-cloud…).
