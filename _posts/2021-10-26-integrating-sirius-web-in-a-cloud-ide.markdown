Last year, we have presented the first version of [Sirius Web](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web), the cloud-based evolution of Eclipse Sirius, during [EclipseCon Europe 2020](https://www.eclipsecon.org/2020/sessions/sirius-web-100-open-source-cloud-modeling-platform).
With Sirius Web, you can easily build your modeling workbench and deploy it in the cloud.
With this new edition of EclipseCon Europe, it's time for us to share with you what we've been working on for the past few months.

Among the best new features available with the latest version of Sirius Web, you will now have the ability to [build your modeling tools without leaving your web browser](https://www.eclipsecon.org/2021/sessions/alices-adventures-sirius-web-land).
It is now possible to define both the concepts of your domain and the diagram representations to manipulate those concepts from the web browser.
No need to generate code or to restart the server for you to get started with your domain.
You can easily create new kinds of diagrams and start interacting with them in a couple clicks.

On top of that, we have also worked to integrate Sirius Web in other platforms such as cloud IDEs.
[On Wednesday](https://www.eclipsecon.org/2021/sessions/zero-one-how-integrate-graphical-editor-cloud-ide), Axel Richard and I will show you Sirius Web in action inside of VS Code and Eclipse Theia.

We will show you how to connect to various Sirius Web or [Obeo Studio](https://www.obeosoft.com/en/products/obeo-studio) servers and retrieve your data and graphical representations.
You will see how you can interact with your diagrams and forms without leaving your VS Code instance.
Of course, all this while keeping the collaborative aspect of Sirius Web and Obeo Studio which allow you to work simultaneously on the same data as your colleagues even using different graphical representations.

Tune in for this talk on [Wednesday 27 Oct 2021 afternoon](https://www.eclipsecon.org/2021/sessions/zero-one-how-integrate-graphical-editor-cloud-ide) during EclipseCon Europe 2021.
